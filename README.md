# Learning Computer Science

Hello, my name is Shahmeer.

I am an intermediate (12th-grade) graduate from Pakistan, currently learning computer science and software development.

This repository contains my beginner-level practice projects as I learn:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python

My goal is to gain real-world experience and work as a remote intern or junior developer.
